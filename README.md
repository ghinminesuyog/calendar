# calendar
A simple calendar that displays upcoming dates and adds event reminders for the selected date.

The project is compatible with Swift 5.0 on XCode 10.3

For now the calendar only displays the calendar and when a date is clicked, prints the selected date on terminal.

Further aim:

        To integrate EventKit so that new events can be created.
